# Grotesca Reforma Variável

[*Grotesca Reforma Variável*](https://caducarvalho.github.io/grotesca-reforma-web) (variable) is a type revival project started in June 2018 with the purpose of creating a variable font based on movable type prints of Grotesca Reforma type family.

Grotesca Reforma was a grotesque sans-serif font family released and retailed in Brazil by Funtimod, a former type foundry and pinting machinery manufacturer. In this digital revision, the font introduces several features in order to modernize Grotesca Reforma and keep its nostalgic appeal.

Grotesca Reforma Variável is a typographic experiment built as a capstone project for the Specialist Degree in Typography of Senac.

## Design

Grotesca Reforma reatins most of the original shapes of its movable type ancestor, but has several modifications in order to harmonize the letters' shapes, improve readability on small sizes and add compatibility with several languages. Many diacritics, ligatures and special characters were added to the main font.

The font family is available in 13 `OTF` fonts, which most of them resemble to the original Funtimod fonts:

| Grotesca Reforma Meio-preta Estreita   | 400        | 100
| Grotesca Reforma Negrito Estreita      | 600        | 100
